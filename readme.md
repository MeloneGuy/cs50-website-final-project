# MeloneGuy Portfolio Website
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5YMomVrT0
#### Description:
Created an example portfolio website where I told more about myself.

Created with Javascript, CSS and HTML.
Used plain HTML, Javascript and CSS on purpose to get familiar with using it during CS50x from Harvard.

## Key features:
- Collapsibles.
- Slider.
- Parallax scrolling (fell in love with this so really wanted to try recreating it myself).
- Image track (scrollable on computer and mobile).
- First time trying out svg files.

## Explanation fo features
### Collapsibles
Personally I dislike a long list of work history on a portfolio page. After looking around on the internet I found the possbility to use collapsibles.
These collapsibles give me the opportunity to press a button and show/hide text.
The biggest challenge for me with the collapsibles was to get the proper width on all elements.

### Slider
The slider in the top right of the page is personally my favorite. I took inspiration from internet on the looks of it.
This one was for sure a challenge. I wrote a JS script that made elements hidden/visible based on the day/night classes.
It was a lot of fun figuring out how to make stars and a cloud in the slider.
This type of website I wanted to make for a longer time already with such a switch button. CS50x finally made me commit to making it.

### Parallax scrolling
Personally I've always been a big fan of parallax scrolling effects if done right.
Without going too much in detail I created the homepage to have multiple parallax scrolling effects.
I really enjoy how it turned out with the moon becoming visible and the sun fading away.
Personally one of my favorite pieces/sections of the website.

### Image track
Absolute nightmare to make.
Scrolling for computer? Done! Oh wait we need scrolling for mobile too? Done!
But then viewports and dimensions came into play. What if the images aren't equal in size, dimension and style?
Lots of trying out, testing and more trying out.
Happy with the results but definetly one of the things that kept me up at night trying to solve it.

### SVG files
The page was kind of bland at the beginning, using a SVG generator I made SVG files to create sections on the page.
Really proud of the end result.

This was CS50. Thank you for reading.
