# MeloneGuy Portfolio Website
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5YMomVrT0
#### Description:
Created an example portfolio website where I told more about myself.

Created with Javascript, CSS and HTML.
Used plain HTML, Javascript and CSS on purpose to get familiar with using it during CS50x from Harvard.

## Key features:
- Collapsibles.
- Slider.
- Parallax scrolling (fell in love with this so really wanted to try recreating it myself).
- Image track (scrollable on computer and mobile).
- First time trying out svg files.
